# EvolutionaryPathPlanning
This code shows the integration of MATLAB with Vrep (virtual robotic simulator) using a remote API and simple BAS implementation for path planning in 2D plane free of obstacles.
It also shows the Path planning for a differential robot achieved using Beetle Antenae Search algorithm.
The position of the robot is controlled using PID controller.
